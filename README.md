# ReClass.NET-KernelPlugin
A simple kernel-level read/write/query/info plug-in for use in ReClass.NET

If you plan on using the driver, you will need to sign it yourself.

Made this a while ago but never got around to finishing it till yesterday, and after some testing, seems to work OK.
There is no debugging features added from the kernel side, but they can be added at a later date if i get around to it.
